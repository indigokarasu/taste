# Dispatch 18:46 (2026-06-25): Taste scan + Styx enrichment

## Taste Scan Result
- OAuth token repair required on both accounts (Mode 1: `+00:00` suffix)
- Combined repair: `python3 -c "<repair>" && cd <dir> && /usr/bin/python3 <scan>`
- 1 new signal created: Next Level VG via DoorDash ($76.66, San Francisco, 475 Hampshire St)
- Services scanned: doordart, instacart, good_eggs, tock, opentable, yelp, amazon, hotels
- Totals: 4,747 signals | 1,318 items

## Styx Universal Enrichment
- Script: `python3 /root/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-styx/scripts/styx_universal_enrich.py --limit 0`
- 31 merchants enriched (new: Taco Los Altos, Philz Coffee, lululemon SF, Extreme Pizza, Serrano's Pizza, Etsy shops, Heritage Thai Spa, Berkeley Bowl, etc.)
- 8 failed (non-placeable): Kalshi, Lugg Hold, Querytracker, Citi Autopay, Harbor View HOA, Livykate Clothing, Alves Cleaning, SP LIVYKATE
- Remaining unenriched non-financial: 69 (all expected non-placeable)

## Email Triage (Jared's account)
- All 4 threads confirmed no-action (informational/transactional/resolved)
- GLG thread: Jared already replied declining, Mason acknowledged
- Office Hours: recurring solicitation, no response needed
- Dialectica survey: paid survey follow-up, no action (confirmed pattern)

## Email Triage (Indigo's account)
- PR #12: approved by akramcodez (LGTM)
- PR #13: new blocker — double HTML escaping regression in processParagraph()
- Newspapers.com: marketing, no action
- Wikipedia: login verification code

## Journal Pipelines
- Dispatch referenced forge-scan and mentor-light files that were already processed
- Re-detection only — no new entries to process
- Steady-state across all three pipelines (Forge, Mentor, Praxis)

## Key Observations
- OAuth suffix is truly per-scan, not per-day — 6+ repairs in one day
- Styx enrichment converging: only non-placeable merchants remain
- Email triage working correctly: no false escalations
