# Dispatch Wave (2026-06-26T14:34Z) — Genuine Mixed: Email Flag + Taste Success + Journal Second-Wave

**Trigger:** Cron dispatcher detected 3 items: new_emails (5 jared + 1 indigo), new_journals (2 files), taste_new_data (5 items).

## Email Triage (Genuine)

### jared.zimmerman@gmail.com (5 threads)
- Indigo dream journal → no action (personal)
- Product Visualization Software reply → no action (Jared already replied declining)
- **AlphaSights Project Proposal (Raphael Gold) → FLAGGED** — requires Jared's personal decision on Healthcare Software/AI expert call
- Kickstargogo solar cap → no action (spam)
- Abbott shipment notification → no action (tracking update, FedEx 873586157719)

### mx.indigo.karasu@gmail.com (1 thread)
- Morning Briefing → no action (self-sent)

**Result:** 1 escalation (AlphaSights), 5 no-action.

## Journal Pipeline (Second-Wave, No-Op)

Both `new_files` already in eval:
- `ocas-dispatch/2026-06-26/dispatch-wave-20260626T142800Z.json` ✅ in eval
- `ocas-mentor/2026-06-26/mentor-light-20260626T142559Z.json` ✅ in eval

No pipeline execution needed.

## Taste Scan (Genuine)

- Token repair: both accounts had timezone suffix (`+00:00`) — fixed in single chained call
- 2 new signals: Hard Knox Cafe ($26.77) + Next Level VG ($76.66) via DoorDash
- Post-scan dedup: 8 duplicates removed (4713 → 4705)
- **Path fix:** `dispatch_taste_dedup.py` does NOT exist under `commons/data/ocas-taste/scripts/` — must use absolute path `/root/.hermes/profiles/indigo/skills/ocas-taste/scripts/dispatch_taste_dedup.py`

## Key Pattern

Genuine mixed dispatch: email triage found 1 escalation, taste scan found 2 new signals, journals were second-wave. The dispatch-wave journal documented all three pipelines' results. State advanced, eval file updated, no post-dispatch gaps.
