# Dispatch #66 (2026-06-25T03:53Z) — Taste Token Repair + 2 Signals

**Trigger:** `taste_new_data` dispatch item with 2 new signals detected

## What Happened

- **Token repair:** Both accounts had timezone suffix (`+00:00`) in expiry field. Repaired in single `terminal()` call chained with scan.
- **Scan:** `scan-incremental 24` processed 2 DoorDash extractions:
  - Next Level VG: $76.66 (475 Hampshire St, San Francisco, CA)
  - Lavash: $64.60 (475 Hampshire St, San Francisco, CA)
- **Signals:** 2 created, both restaurant domain, both via DoorDash

## Key Observations

### Token repair race condition (confirmed again)

Both jared.zimmerman@gmail.com and mx.indigo.karasu@gmail.com had Mode 1 failure (timezone suffix `+00:00`). The repair MUST be chained with the scan in a single `terminal()` call — separate calls fail because OAuth refresh re-adds the suffix.

### DoorDash orders from same address

Both orders delivered to 475 Hampshire St, San Francisco, CA 94110 — Jared's address. This is consistent with the consumption pattern.

## Verification

- ✅ Token repair: both accounts fixed
- ✅ Signals: 2 created (Next Level VG, Lavash)
- ✅ Journal: written to ocas-taste/2026-06-25/
