# Historical Scan Authentication

## Issue
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
The historical email and calendar scans (`taste.historical.email` and `taste.historical.calendar`) failed due to incorrect OAuth token usage. The script was authenticating as the agent account (`<third-party-or-user-email>`) instead of <operator>'s account (`<user-google-email>`). This caused the scans to miss 10 years of Gmail and calendar history.

## Root Cause
- The script was using the agent's credentials (`<user-google-email>.json`) instead of <operator>'s credentials (`<hermes-home>/<user-google-email>.json`).
- The historical scans were not explicitly configured to use <operator>'s credentials.

## Fix
Always use <operator>'s credentials (`<hermes-home>/<user-google-email>.json`) for historical scans. The credentials file must be loaded and used explicitly:

```python
# Load <operator>'s credentials
with open("<hermes-home>/<user-google-email>.json", "r") as f:

## Verification
After applying the fix, verify the following:
1. The historical scans (`taste.historical.email` and `taste.historical.calendar`) run successfully.
