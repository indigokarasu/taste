# Dispatch Wave (2026-06-26T16:57Z) — Clean Sweep + Taste Signal

**Trigger:** Cron dispatcher detected 3 items: new_emails (1 jared + 1 indigo), new_journals (4 files), taste_new_data (137 signals).

## Outcome

- **Email:** Self-sent job briefing flagged as actionable (sender_email was empty string, sender_name had the address). No triage needed.
- **Journals:** 4 files (3 rally research, 1 mentor heartbeat) — all already ingested by originating systems.
- **Taste:** 1 new signal (Hard Knox Cafe via DoorDash, $26.77). Dedup removed 1 duplicate (4843 → 4842).

## Token Repair

Both accounts required timezone suffix stripping again — confirms per-scan repair is mandatory, not a one-time fix.

## Pattern

Second dispatch wave of the day with taste activity. Morning wave (14:34Z) had 2 signals + email escalation; afternoon wave (16:57Z) had 1 signal + clean sweep. DoorDash orders are a reliable daily signal source.
