"""Garbage signal cleanup helper.

Removes signals with no real venue and deduplicates across
(venue_name, event_date, extraction_source, domain). Also filters
generic calendar meal-titles (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Brunch) that
aren't real venue names. Writes the cleaned set back to the same JSONL file.

Usage:
